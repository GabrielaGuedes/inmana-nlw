# Inmana

Project developed during the [NLW](https://nextlevelweek.com/)#5.
This is an app to manage the supplies that each restaurant has. It sends an email every week with all the supplies that are about to pass the due date.

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
